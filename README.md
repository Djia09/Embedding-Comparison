# Embedding-Comparison
Since the rise of Word Embedding and Mikolov's Word2Vec model developed in this [article](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf), a new challenge has quickly appeared: Sentence Embedding. 

In this repo, we compare different state-of-the-art sentence embedding methods and compare them in several tasks given in SemEval-2017.

# SemEval
We evaluate our models with 3 tasks:
* Task 2 focuses on Word level (Word pairs comparison).
* Task 1 focuses on Sentence level (Sentence pairs comparison).
* Task 4 focuses on Sentence level, but on a deeper one (Sentiment Analysis).
